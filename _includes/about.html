		    <hs>My lab is  currently recruting up to two masters or PhD students to join the lab in August 2026. See annoucement and how to apply <a href="https://nathanwhelan.github.io/assests/Grad_Recruitment_2025.pdf">here.</a> Potential lab members are encouraged to read our lab manual to learn more about the lab and expectations of lab members. <a href="https://nathanwhelan.github.io/assests/Lab-Manual_Aug2025.pdf">Lab Manual 2025</a></hs>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">About My Lab's Research</h2>
                    <hs>I am the Director of the <a href="https://mbd.osu.edu/">Museum of Biological Diversity</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu">The Ohio State University.</a></hs>
		    <p></p>
	            <hs>My lab is broadly interested in relationships among organisms, the evolutionary processes that generate biodiversity, and how environmental change influences genetic patterns. The lab's primary research organisms are freshwater mollusks, but we also work on a wide variery of freshwater taxa. The lab can broadly be characterized as a systematics and conseravtion genetics lab.</br></hs>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Leaders in Conservation Genetics, Systematics, and Collections-Based Research</h3>
			<hs>I believe in applying adaptive leadership skills to ensure my research is translated into improved conservation outcomes. I am also constantly working to foster a work environment where students and permanent staff can thrive and achieve their career goals. I think that research labs are most successful when all lab members feel empowered to pursue their research interests and become leaders in the field. I also value collaboration with a wide variety of partners. You can learn more about my lab, its research, and expectations for lab members by visiting links to projects below and by reading my lab’s manual. <a href="https://nathanwhelan.github.io/assests/Lab-Manual_Aug2025.pdf">Lab Manual 2024</a></hs>

                                    <p>Freshwater mollusks are the lab's primary study organisms. One reason we study mollusks is to enhance conservation efforts. The health of many freshwater ecosystems, and therefore much of society, rely on freshwater snails and mussels. Unfortunately, over 75% of freshwater mussels and snails are at risk of extinction, and the greatest barrier to effective conservation is a lack of knowledge. We use phylogenetics and conservation genomics to better understand freshwater mollusks.</p>

                                    <p>My lab seeks to understand the patterns and processes that have contributed to animal diversification. Our primary study organisms are invertebrates. We have a number of ongoing projects on phylogenomics of freshwater mollusks and conservation genomics of animals ranging from freshwater snails to sturgeon. We are also interested in evolution of gene families, particulary those involved with invertebrate adaptation to freshwater environments.</p>

                                    <p>A consequence of species decline is often a decline in population-level genetic diversity. Our research aims to understand how conservation efforts can maintain or increase genetic diversity of managed populations and species. We also seek to better understand the molecular ecology of threatened and endangered species. For this research, our lab collaborates with landowners and hatcheries. We also spend time in the field sampling at-risk, threatened, and endangered species, with a focus on rivers in the southeastern United States.</p>
