                                    <p>My lab seeks to understand the patterns and processes that have contributed to animal diversification. Our primary study organisms are invertebrates. We have a number of ongoing projects on phylogenomics of freshwater mollusks and conservation genomics of animals ranging from freshwater snails to sturgeon. We are also interested in evolution of gene families, particulary those involved with invertebrate adaptation to freshwater environments.</p>

                                    <p>Freshwater mollusks are important components of freshwater systems. Snails graze on algae and are a food source to other animals such as turtles and fish. Mussels naturally filter water and many species live for over fifty years. Together snails and mussels help keep water resources clean for the benefit of human society. Yet, freshwater mollusks are one of the most imperiled groups of organisms on the planet.<br><br>Our research aims to improve conservation efforts and understand molluscan diversity by examining mollusk phylogeny and evolutionary genomics. We answer questions about molluscan evolution using genomic data. This includes transcriptome sequencing, RAD-seq for population genomics, and target-capture Illumina sequencing for phylogenetics. Current projects include conservation genomics of Round Rocksnail (<i>Leptoxis ampla</i>) and Louisiana Pearlshell (<i>Margaratifera hembeli</i>), phylogenomics of the snail family Pleuroceridae, and genome sequencing of Round Rocksnail and Lacy Elimia (<i>Elimia crenatella</i>).</p>

                                    <p>A consequence of species decline is often a decline in population-level genetic diversity. Effective conservation must include efforts to increase population-level genetic diversity of any given imperiled species. My research aims to understand how conservation efforts can increase genetic diversity of managed populations and species. We also seek to better understand the molecular ecology of threatened and endangered species. This work includes collaborating landowners and hatcheries. We also spend time in the field sampling threatened and endangered species, with a focus on rivers in the southeastern United States.</p>

Part of my lab's research includes designing new bioinformatics pipelines for evolutionary research. We also study the performance of different phylogenetic methods in an effort to determine which models and methods can provide the most accurate estimation of organismal relationships.</p>
